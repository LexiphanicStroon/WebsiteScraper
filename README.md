### About

This is a web scraping boilerplate for you to use to make your life easier.

### Use cases

I first used this to collect articles on a certain topic from a variety of news sources without needing to dig through them myself. Simply inspect element, find the keyword you want to target, then add it to the selector. 
You can add any number of news sources and topics and it will automatically handle it.

If you're a writer for a certain niche/researcher you can use this to quickly aggregate articles from a long list of websites on one topic without needing to deal with somebody's poorly made CMS search.

I then repurposed this for a local movie theatre. They did not have a system to remind patrons when a new movie was arriving in town. I built a simple web app around it which would allow users to select the movie, date, and showtime, and receive a Twilio text message to be reminded when that movie was playing.
